# Principles (Horizon 5)

*Principles define the parameters of action and criteria for excellence of conduct.*

Principles represent core values and standards, providing the HOW that accompanies purpose's WHY. While purpose provides direction and motivation, principles establish the nature and quality of your being.

## Core Values

### Integrity

*Example: Keep your word. Be honest in all dealings. Do what you say you'll do.*

### Excellence

*Example: Strive for quality in everything you do. Continuous improvement. High standards.*

### Courage

*Example: Face challenges directly. Do the right thing even when it's difficult.*

### Kindness

*Example: Treat others with compassion and respect. Look for ways to help.*

### Growth

*Example: Learn from mistakes. Seek feedback. Stay curious and open-minded.*

### [Your Principle]

*Define what this means to you and how it guides your behavior*

## How to Use This

When faced with decisions or evaluating your behavior, check against your principles. These are the standards you hold yourself to across all contexts. When principles are honored, you feel alignment and peace. When violated, you feel discomfort and stress.

Review and refine your principles during quarterly reviews. They should be stable but can evolve as you grow.
